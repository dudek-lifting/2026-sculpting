<section id="scenario">
  <h2>Scenario</h2>
  <p>A Yahoo Mail customer is locked out of their email account and calls the contact center for help. The agent verifies the caller using non-sensitive methods, diagnoses the lockout cause, initiates account recovery steps, and confirms restored access or next steps.</p>
</section>

<section id="assumptions">
  <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <li>The agent has access to internal account recovery tools and status indicators.</li>
    <li>Verification is performed without collecting sensitive personal data.</li>
    <li>Brand colors are inferred from public branding; exact hex overrides can be provided if desired.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="prep">
  <h2>Agent Prep</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Be ready to explain the recovery process clearly and calmly.</li>
